     error:

     it looks like the Rust project used to create this wasm file was linked against
     a different version of wasm-bindgen than this binary:

       rust wasm file: 0.2.73 (c8fb41faf)
	  this binary: 0.2.73

     Currently the bindgen format is unstable enough that these two version must
     exactly match, so it's required that these two version are kept in sync by
     either updating the wasm-bindgen dependency or this binary. You should be able
     to update the wasm-bindgen dependency with:

	 cargo update -p wasm-bindgen

     or you can update the binary with

	 cargo install -f wasm-bindgen-cli

     if this warning fails to go away though and you're not sure what to do feel free
     to open an issue at https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues!
