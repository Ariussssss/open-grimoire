Here's what worked for me.

Install the needed tools (make sure to enable unprivileged access when prompted):

#+begin_src bash
  ;sudo apt install spice-vdagent spice-webdavd davfs2
  curl http://127.0.0.1:9843/
  sudo mkdir /mnt/shared
  # empty user and pass here
  sudo mount -t davfs -o noexec http://127.0.0.1:9843/ /mnt/shared/

  # "anyuser" and "anypass" can really be anything,
  # but seems to be required when specifying in the file.
  sudo cat >> /etc/davfs2/secrets << EOF
    # mounted UTM directory
    /mnt/shared anyuser anypass
    EOF
  # add to fstab
  sudo cat >> /etc/fstab << EOF
  # mounted UTM directory
  http://127.0.0.1:9843/ /mnt/shared davfs _netdev,user 0 0
  EOF
#+end_src
Reboot the VM with sudo systemctl reboot and the mount should be there when the system boots.
